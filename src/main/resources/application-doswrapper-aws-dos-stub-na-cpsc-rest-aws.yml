# AWS Deployment - running Elastic Beanstalk hosting Docker Containers
#
# Uses DosStubClient so no external SOAP calls are made
# Uses CapacityServiceRestClient (in Capacity Service Client module) so REST calls to the AWS Capacity Service will occur

# This is the URL for the AWS Capacity Service API - note the API username and password should be passed in every
# call by the Capacity Service client but these values are passed using runtime environment variables.
# The environment variable names are:
# "capacity.service.client.api.username" & "capacity.service.client.api.password"
